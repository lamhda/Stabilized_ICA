# Stabilized_ICA

This repository proposes a python implementation for stabilized ICA decomposition algorithm. Most of the technical details can be found in the references [1], [2] and [3].    
   
We also propose an implementation of the Mutual Nearest Neighbors method as well as a visualization tool to draw the associated network. This method is used to study the stability of the ICA components through different datasets.

## Experiments

We provide two jupyter notebooks for an illustration with transcriptomic data:
* [ICA decomposition with stabilized ICA](transcriptomic_ICA.ipynb)
* [Stability of ICA components accross several NSCLC cohorts](stability_study.ipynb)

## Data

The data set which goes with the jupyter notebook ["ICA decomposition with stabilized ICA"](transcriptomic_ICA.ipynb) can be found in the .zip file [data.zip](data.zip). Please extract locally the data set before running the notebook.   

For the jupyter notebook ["Stability of ICA components accross several NSCLC cohorts"](stability_study.ipynb) please note that you will have to load the data yourself in order to run it (all the necessary links are reported on the notebook).

## Requirements

To run this algorithm as well as the jupyter notebook, one will need the following python packages:
* joblib
* json
* matplotlib.pyplot
* networkx
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* scipy
* tdqm
